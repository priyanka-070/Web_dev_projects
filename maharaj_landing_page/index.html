        <img src="C:\Users\Acer\Desktop\Priyanka\priya\raja.jpg">
        <p>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born on February 19, 1630, at Shivneri Fort in present-day Maharashtra. He was the son of Shahaji Bhosale, a Maratha general, and Jijabai, who played a crucial role in shaping his values and vision.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\Acer\Desktop\Priyanka\priya\raje1.jpg">
        <p> From a young age, Shivaji aspired to establish Hindavi Swarajya (self-rule) and started expanding his territory by capturing forts like Torna, Rajgad, and Kondhana. His guerrilla warfare tactics helped him resist the powerful Mughal and Adilshahi empires.

            In 1659, he defeated Afzal Khan, a general of the Adilshahi Sultanate, at Pratapgad Fort, marking a significant victory. Over the years, he fought against the Mughals, capturing key territories and forts. In 1674, he was formally crowned Chatrapati (king) at Raigad Fort, establishing the Maratha Empire. He introduced efficient administrative reforms, a strong navy, and a fair taxation system.
            
            Shivaji Maharaj passed away on April 3, 1680, but his legacy lived on, inspiring future generations, including the Maratha rulers and Indian freedom fighters. His vision of self-rule, military excellence, and justice continues to be celebrated across India today.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\Acer\Desktop\Priyanka\priya\legacy.jpg">
        <p>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's legacy is deeply embedded in Indian history, inspiring generations with his leadership, military strategies, and governance. As the founder of the Maratha Empire, he established Hindavi Swarajya, a vision of self-rule that later influenced India's freedom movement. His administration was highly efficient, with a structured government led by the Ashta Pradhan (Eight Ministers), and he promoted justice, religious tolerance, and economic growth. A master of guerrilla warfare, Shivaji revolutionized military tactics and built an extensive network of forts, including Raigad, Sinhagad, and Pratapgad, which played crucial roles in his campaigns. His naval force was one of the first indigenous maritime defenses in India, protecting the Konkan coast from foreign invaders. Shivaji was also a cultural icon, fostering the use of Marathi and Sanskrit in governance, ensuring equal opportunities for all, and protecting civilians, women, and religious institutions. His influence extended beyond his time, inspiring freedom fighters like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Mahatma Gandhi. Today, his legacy is honored through Shivaji Jayanti, statues, universities, and military institutions like INS Shivaji. His vision of justice, strength, and self-rule continues to inspire millions across India.</p>
